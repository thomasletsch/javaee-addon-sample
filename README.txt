This is a sample application to show the usage of the JavaEE Vaadin Addon.

The sample application can be deployed in a JBoss 7 application server. It uses the H2 driver which is part of JBoss vanilla. 
Just deploy the sample-ds.xml file along with the javaee-addon-sample.war.

Tested and used with JBoss 7.1.

The JavaEE Addon is compatible to Vaadin 7! No stable version!
